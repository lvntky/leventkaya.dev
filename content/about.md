Hi, my name is Levent. I work as a software engineer. I wrote a few big projects, operating system, emulators etc. I actually created this site to write my blog posts. I know you found this theme a bit strange in 202x. But I think a website should be look and work like this. After all, you can find what you're looking for, right? Well, I guess that's enough. While doing this, I was influenced by [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/) and [Nothing's](http://nothings.org/) websites. Anyways, You can read the blogs I occasionally write in the Posts section, I usually write about low level programming. Have fun.
