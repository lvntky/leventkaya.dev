First of all I would like to thank all the interest and good comments for CVM++, this was a fun weekend project and I won't expecting this much. Thanks :)

This is the final state of the CVM++, we have three main parts, the first one is classfile related code which helps to parse and load the classfile into the our virtual machine's memory(See the part 1 for more detailed information about classfile), the second one is stack for working on local variables etc and finally the execute engine which is executes the given instructions in our virtual machine. Those three parts (which accomplished in ~800 LoC) is sufficent enough to run very simple programs.

## Load and GO!

<img src="/assets/images/cvm/load_and_go.png    " alt="Github Stars" class="responsive-img" style="max-width: 800px;">

This is how load and run mechanism works in CVM++(and most likely any other toy/primitive JVM). 

As you know I intruduce the parseing and loading process of classfile of the first part of this blog post. 
After we load classfile into the memory we are looking for `main` method in our `.class` file. If the classfile don't contain any main method then we are not intreprete or run anything on this file. After that when we validet that the classfile contains a main method then we are trying to get Code attribute of the class. You can see the Attribute parsing process here:

```sh
  Methods Count:      2
  Methods:
  [
  Method:
  access_flags: 0x0000
  name_index: 5
  descriptor_index: 6
  attributes_count: 1
  attributes: [
Attribute:
  attribute_name_index: 9
  attribute_length: 29
  info: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 5, 42, 183, 0, 1, 177, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]

  ]
  Method:
  access_flags: 0x0009
  name_index: 11
  descriptor_index: 12
  attributes_count: 1
  attributes: [
Attribute:
  attribute_name_index: 9
  attribute_length: 48
  info: [0, 2, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 12, 16, 14, 60, 16, 15, 61, 27, 28, 96, 62, 29, 172, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 10, 0, 0, 0, 18, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 6, 0, 6, 0, 10, 0, 7]

  ]

  ]
  Attributes Count:   1
  Attributes:
  [
  Attribute:
  attribute_name_index: 13
  attribute_length: 2
  info: [0, 14]

  ]
  ```

  Now let's take a closer look into the attribute with access_flags: 0x0009, i printed the attribute information to the stdout for better understanding and debugging purposes.

  The first four data in the attribute with access_flags: 0x0009:
```cpp
[0, 2, 0, 4]
```
  Now take a look at the image above:
```sh
[2024-07-30 14:32:43.607] [info] ==> Opcode: 0X0 - NOP - DO NOTHING
[2024-07-30 14:32:43.607] [info] ==> Opcode 0X2 - iconst_m1 - Load m1 to the operand stack: [-1]
[2024-07-30 14:32:43.607] [info] ==> Opcode: 0X0 - NOP - DO NOTHING
[2024-07-30 14:32:43.607] [info] ==> Opcode 0X4 - iconst_1 - Load 1 to the operand stack: [-1, 1]
```

Can you see the pattern?

Yes, these are our opcodes, they are coming from the `Code Attribute` then we are pasing them as opcodes, interpreting(to cpp) and running them :)

## The Execution Process
cvm_execute.hpp:

```c++
#ifndef __CVM_EXECUTE_HPP__
#define __CVM_EXECUTE_HPP__

#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <vector>

#include "../classfile/classfile.hpp"
#include "../log.hpp"

class CVM {
 public:
  CVM() = default;
  void execute(const Classfile& cf, const std::string& methodName);
  std::string return_value;

 private:
  std::string getUtf8FromConstantPool(const Classfile& cf, uint16_t index);
  const method_info* findMehodByName(const Classfile& cf,
                                     const std::string& methodName);
  const uint8_t* getByteCode(const Classfile& cf,
                             const method_info* methodInfo);
  void interprete(const uint8_t* byteCode, const Classfile& cf);
};

#endif  //__CVM_EXECUTE_HPP__
```

Now, let's delve deeper into the execution process itself. The CVM class is responsible for interpreting and executing the bytecode instructions from a Java .class file. Here's a closer look at the key components and their roles in the execution process.

### The CVM Class

The CVM class is defined in cvm_execute.hpp and implemented in cvm_execute.cpp. It has the following main methods:

- `execute(const Classfile& cf, const std::string& methodName)`: This method starts the execution process for a given method in the class file.
- `getUtf8FromConstantPool(const Classfile& cf, uint16_t index)`: Retrieves a UTF-8 string from the constant pool of the class file.
- `findMehodByName(const Classfile& cf, const std::string& methodName)`: Finds a method by its name in the class file.
- `getByteCode(const Classfile& cf, const method_info* methodInfo)`: Retrieves the bytecode of a method.
- `interprete(const uint8_t* byteCode, const Classfile& cf)`: Interprets and executes the bytecode instructions.

### Bytecode Interpretation

The core of the execution process is in the interprete method, which loops through the bytecode and executes each instruction. Here's an overview of how some of the bytecode instructions are handled:

- 0x00 (NOP): No operation. The program counter simply moves to the next instruction.
- 0x02 (iconst_m1): Pushes the integer -1 onto the operand stack.
- 0x03 (iconst_0): Pushes the integer 0 onto the operand stack.
- 0x04 (iconst_1): Pushes the integer 1 onto the operand stack.
- 0x10 (bipush): Pushes a byte onto the operand stack after sign-extending it to an integer.
- 0x3c (istore_1): Pops the top of the operand stack and stores it in local variable 1.
- 0x3d (istore_2): Pops the top of the operand stack and stores it in local variable 2.
- 0x3e (istore_3): Pops the top of the operand stack and stores it in local variable 3.
- 0x1b (iload_1): Loads the value of local variable 1 onto the operand stack.
- 0x1c (iload_2): Loads the value of local variable 2 onto the operand stack.
- 0x1d (iload_3): Loads the value of local variable 3 onto the operand stack.
- 0x60 (iadd): Pops the top two values from the operand stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the operand stack.
- 0xac (ireturn): Pops the top value from the operand stack and sets it as the return value.

### Operand Stack
In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) architecture (and in CVM too), the operand stack is a critical component. It operates as a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack used for evaluating expressions and storing intermediate results during the execution of bytecode instructions. The operand stack is local to each stack frame, and each method invocation in the JVM has its own operand stack.
#### How It Works

- Pushing Operands: When executing a bytecode instruction that requires operands, such as an addition operation, the operands are pushed onto the operand stack.
- Executing Instructions: The JVM executes the bytecode instructions by popping operands from the operand stack, performing the operation, and then pushing the result back onto the operand stack.
- Intermediate Results: The operand stack holds intermediate results temporarily as the JVM executes the bytecode instructions for a method.

## Moment of Truth
So I hope you understand the working mechanism of CVM, lets run a real compiled java class into it and see what happens.
This is the java program that we gonna test with CVM:

```java
class AddMain {

    public static int main(String args[]) {
        int a = 14;
        int b = 15;
        int c = a + b;
        return c;
    }

}
```
and this is what happens when we run it with `./cvm AddMain.class`

CVM successfully terminated program: sample/AddMain.class with return value : 29
```

I think it works!

## What is Missing in CVM++?

Like, almost everything... CVM is not a production-ready software.

It lacks of proper memory management utility, for example you can't work with Object variables or you can't allocate memory, because we don't have any heap implemented. Or there is only very small subset of java opcodes has been implemented.

It's only works for very primitive and small programs...

## Whar I am Proud of?

- It works with *Real* Java programs: The programs that CVM runs are compiled with `javac` which is a real Java compiler into real .class files. There is no pseudo-code or something intermediate language, this is just real Java.

- It's compact: CVM is a PoC of you can write a Java Virtual Machine in ~800 lines of C++ code, in a week-end. Which i found cool.

- Extensively logged: CVM log's every step while executing Java programs(even the current state of the stack).

- It's FUN: Yeah it's a fun project. Computing is fun, computers are fun. This is what i believe and this is what i do. I like to show people that writing code is don't have to be boring or you must have to get a profit out of your code. You can just write code for only sake of writing code and having fun with it, just like they do in the good old days :)
