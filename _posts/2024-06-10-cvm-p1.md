# The `CVM`++
About a year ago, I decided to write a jvm in C, and I did. It just wasn't quite what I wanted and it lacked many functions. Actually, I wrote a java debugger on a binary level rather than a jvm. A year later, I decided to look at this project again and give it the functionality it deserves. This time, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and do it in C++ instead of C (Also, I'm too old to deal with string manipulation in C anymore).

I believe this series will be quite long and will be useful for both Java and C++. Welcome to the first part.

## The Functional Requirements
Since I didn't want to make the same mistakes as last time, I wanted to start by writing the functional requirements of the jvm that I wanted to create. The software I will make throughout this series will have the following functional requirements.

- Class loading
  - Load classes from the file system
  - Resolve symbolic references.
- Bytecode verification
  - Verify bytecode integrity to prevent security vulnerabilities and ensure correct behavior.
  - Perform structural and behavioral checks on bytecode instructions.
- Runtime Data Areas
  - Implement runtime data areas such as heap, method area, program counter (PC), stack, and native method stacks.
  - Manage memory allocation and deallocation.
  - Handle thread-local storage for each thread executing on the JVM.
- Execution Engine
  - Interpret bytecode instructions or use just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.
  - Support execution of Java bytecode instructions according to the Java Virtual Machine Specification.
  - Implement support for core instructions like load/store, arithmetic, flow control, method invocation, and exception handling.
  
Of course, a JVM that can be used for real production should have much more than these features. But my goal in this series is to make a working jvm, it does not need to be used in the real world.

## What is the ```.class``` file ?

A .class file is a binary file format used by the Java programming language to store compiled Java bytecode. When you compile a Java source file (.java), the Java compiler (javac) generates a .class file for each class defined in the source code.

**The structure of .class**

A .class file follows a specific structure defined by the Java Virtual Machine Specification. Here's a brief overview of its structure:

- Magic Number: The first 4 bytes of the file represent a magic number (0xCAFEBABE), which identifies it as a valid Java class file.
- Version Information: The next 4 bytes represent the minor and major version numbers of the Java compiler used to generate the file.
- Constant Pool: The constant pool contains various constant values used by the class (e.g., strings, numbers, class and method references). It starts with a 2-byte count of entries in the pool.
- Access Flags: 2 bytes representing access flags indicating the access permissions and properties of the class.
- This Class and Super Class: 2 bytes each representing indices into the constant pool, specifying the class and its direct superclass.
- Interfaces: 2 bytes representing the number of interfaces implemented by the class, followed by 2-byte indices into the constant pool for each interface.
- Fields: 2 bytes representing the number of fields defined in the class, followed by field definitions.
- Methods: 2 bytes representing the number of methods defined in the class, followed by method definitions.
- Attributes: Additional attributes, such as annotations, debugging information, and method code, are stored as attributes.

**The purpose of .class:**

`.class` files serve as the intermediary between Java source code and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). They contain the compiled bytecode, which is platform-independent and can be executed by any JVM regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system. When you run a Java application, the JVM loads the appropriate .class files, interprets the bytecode, and executes the program instructions.

## A Humble Goal
![goal](/assets/images/cvm/goal.gif)

My modest goal is this, I will write a very small Java program and my own JVM will run this program. For this, I created a structure like this:

```sh
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── Dockerfile
├── LICENSE
├── Makefile
├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── README.md
├── cmake
│   ├── CVMConfig.cmake.in
│   ├── CompilerWarnings.cmake
│   ├── Conan.cmake
│   ├── Doxygen.cmake
│   ├── SourcesAndHeaders.cmake
│   ├── StandardSettings.cmake
│   ├── StaticAnalyzers.cmake
│   ├── Utils.cmake
│   ├── Vcpkg.cmake
│   └── version.hpp.in
├── codecov.yaml
├── docs
│   └── banner.jpg
├── include
│   └── cvm
│       ├── fmt_commons.hpp
│       └── tmp.hpp
├── sample
│   ├── Add.class
│   └── Add.java
├── src
│   ├── main.cpp
│   └── tmp.cpp
└── test
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── src
        └── tmp_test.cpp
```

I thought it was a modern and very versatile project structure, so I started writing the Java code that I would run next.

```java
  public class Add {
      public static int add(int a, int b) {
          return a + b;
      }
  }
```

As you can see, it is a very simple program, then I compiled this program with javac and created the .class file.

The hexdump of the .class file:

```sh

```

We will be doing a detailed review of this hexdump in the series. But I would like to draw attention to the phrase cafe babe at the beginning. This is a magic number used to verify that what the JVM is reading is a .class file. Maybe I'll tell you his story sometime. Anyway, after this point, I had a .class file, now all I have to do is load this class file and then parse it. At this point, I'm taking advantage of [Oracle's JVM specification](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/).

## The ClassLoader
So here is my base class loader class:

<img src="/assets/images/cvm/class_loader.png" alt="Class Loader" class="responsive-img" style="max-width: 700px;">

I started the project with this simple loader. Basically, its function is to load the class file compiled with javac into memory and validate it.

- ```std::vector<uint8_t> loadClassFile(const std::string& filePath):``` Loads the .class file from the specified file path into memory.
- ```void parseClassFile(const std::vector<uint8_t>& buffer):``` Parses the contents of the .class file buffer.

Thanks to this class, I was able to import .class files and start processing them. We will examine the structure of these .class files in the next part of the series, until then, goodbye.
